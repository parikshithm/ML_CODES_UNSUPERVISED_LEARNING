Business Decision: Target Subsets of Customers for Sending Deal Information

The primary goal here is to segment customers based on their purchasing habits of Pinot Noir and Champagne. By understanding these segments, Chateau can tailor deal information to specific customer groups, increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and ultimately driving more sales.

Code Description

The provided code performs the following steps:

Loads Data: It reads the chateau.csv file into a pandas DataFrame. This file presumably contains customer information, including their purchase history for different wine types.
Initial Data Inspection:
raw_df.head(): Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to give a quick overview of the data structure and content.
raw_df.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries for each column and their data types. This helps in identifying missing values and understanding data types.
raw_df.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical columns. This offers insights into the distribution and range of purchase quantities for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Feature Selection: It creates a new DataFrame selected_columns_df containing only the PinotNoir and Champagne columns. These two columns are the key features for customer segmentation in this analysis.
Display Selected Data: selected_columns_df is displayed to confirm that only the relevant columns have been selected for further analysis.
Warning Filter: warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') is included to suppress any warnings that might arise during the execution, ensuring a cleaner output.
Potential Next Steps for Analysis

To fully achieve the business objective of targeting customer subsets, here are some likely next steps for the analysis:

Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to the selected_columns_df to group customers with similar purchasing patterns. This will reveal distinct customer segments based on their preference for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Optimal Number of Clusters: If using K-Means, techniques like the "Elbow Method" or "Silhouette Analysis" can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters for effective segmentation.
Visualization: Plotting the clusters (e.g., a scatter plot of Pinot Noir vs. Champagne purchases, colored by cluster) will help visualize the customer segments and understand their characteristics.
Characterize Clusters: Once clusters are formed, analyze the average purchase quantities of Pinot Noir and Champagne within each cluster. This will help define the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., "Champagne Lovers," "Pinot Noir Enthusiasts," "Moderate Buyers").
Deal Strategy Development: Based on the identified customer segments and their characteristics, develop tailored deal strategies. For example:
Customers in a "Champagne Lovers" cluster could receive exclusive Champagne discounts.
"Pinot Noir Enthusiasts" could be targeted with new Pinot Noir releases or special bundles.
Customers who buy both moderately might be interested in mixed wine deals.
Customer Identification: Map the cluster assignments back to the original raw_df using CustomerNo to identify which specific customers belong to each segment. This will allow for direct targeting.
