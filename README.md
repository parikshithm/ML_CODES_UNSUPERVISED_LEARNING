Business Decision: Target Subsets of Customers for Sending Deal Information

The primary goal here is to segment customers based on their purchasing habits of Pinot Noir and Champagne. By understanding these segments, Chateau can tailor deal information to specific customer groups, increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and ultimately driving more sales.

Code Description

The provided code performs the following steps:

Loads Data: It reads the chateau.csv file into a pandas DataFrame. This file presumably contains customer information, including their purchase history for different wine types.
Initial Data Inspection:
raw_df.head(): Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to give a quick overview of the data structure and content.
raw_df.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries for each column and their data types. This helps in identifying missing values and understanding data types.
raw_df.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical columns. This offers insights into the distribution and range of purchase quantities for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Feature Selection: It creates a new DataFrame selected_columns_df containing only the PinotNoir and Champagne columns. These two columns are the key features for customer segmentation in this analysis.
Display Selected Data: selected_columns_df is displayed to confirm that only the relevant columns have been selected for further analysis.
Warning Filter: warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') is included to suppress any warnings that might arise during the execution, ensuring a cleaner output.
Potential Next Steps for Analysis

To fully achieve the business objective of targeting customer subsets, here are some likely next steps for the analysis:

Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to the selected_columns_df to group customers with similar purchasing patterns. This will reveal distinct customer segments based on their preference for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Optimal Number of Clusters: If using K-Means, techniques like the "Elbow Method" or "Silhouette Analysis" can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters for effective segmentation.
Visualization: Plotting the clusters (e.g., a scatter plot of Pinot Noir vs. Champagne purchases, colored by cluster) will help visualize the customer segments and understand their characteristics.
Characterize Clusters: Once clusters are formed, analyze the average purchase quantities of Pinot Noir and Champagne within each cluster. This will help define the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., "Champagne Lovers," "Pinot Noir Enthusiasts," "Moderate Buyers").
Deal Strategy Development: Based on the identified customer segments and their characteristics, develop tailored deal strategies. For example:
Customers in a "Champagne Lovers" cluster could receive exclusive Champagne discounts.
"Pinot Noir Enthusiasts" could be targeted with new Pinot Noir releases or special bundles.
Customers who buy both moderately might be interested in mixed wine deals.
Customer Identification: Map the cluster assignments back to the original raw_df using CustomerNo to identify which specific customers belong to each segment. This will allow for direct targeting.



Business Decision: Profile Suppliers

The main objective is to create profiles of suppliers based on their performance metrics and other relevant attributes. This profiling can help in:

Supplier Selection: Identifying the best suppliers for specific needs.
Risk Management: Understanding potential risks associated with different suppliers.
Performance Improvement: Pinpointing areas where supplier performance can be improved.
Negotiation Strategy: Developing effective strategies for contract negotiations.
Code Description

The provided code performs the following steps:

Loads Data: It reads the suppliers.xlsx Excel file into a pandas DataFrame named raw_df. This file is expected to contain various details about suppliers, including their performance metrics.
Initial Data Inspection: raw_df.head() displays the first few rows of the DataFrame. This is a crucial initial step to:
Verify that the data has been loaded correctly.
Understand the column names and the type of data they contain.
Get a quick glance at the data format and structure.
Potential Next Steps for Analysis

To achieve the business objective of profiling suppliers, here are some logical next steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Depending on the extent of missing data, strategies like imputation or removal of rows/columns might be necessary.
Handle Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate supplier entries to ensure accurate analysis.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure all columns have appropriate data types. For instance, 'Cost/Price' might be an object type and need conversion to numeric.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive Statistics: Use raw_df.describe() to get statistical summaries of numerical columns (e.g., Cost/Price, Srvice_Cooperation, Conforming_Service, Flexibility, After_sale_service, Complaint_Management, Waiting_Time). This will help in understanding the distribution and range of values.
Categorical Analysis: Analyze categorical columns like Business Area to understand the distribution of suppliers across different business segments.
Visualization: Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand the relationships between different metrics and identify potential outliers or patterns. For example:
Distribution of Cost/Price.
Relationship between Cost/Price and Srvice_Cooperation.
Comparison of average Conforming_Service across different Business Areas.
Feature Engineering (if needed):
Create new features that might be more indicative of supplier performance. For example, a composite "Overall Service Score" could be derived from Srvice_Cooperation, Conforming_Service, Flexibility, After_sale_service, and Complaint_Management.
Supplier Segmentation/Clustering:
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) using relevant numerical features (e.g., performance ratings, cost) to group suppliers into distinct segments. This will help identify different types of suppliers (e.g., "High Performance, High Cost," "Reliable but Slow," "Cost-Effective, Moderate Service").
Supplier Profiling:
Once segments are identified, analyze the characteristics of each segment. This involves looking at the average values of various metrics for each cluster and understanding what defines each group.
Assign meaningful labels or descriptions to each supplier profile.
Actionable Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the supplier profiles, develop concrete recommendations for business decisions. For example, if a "High Cost, Low Service" segment is identified, strategies for negotiation or seeking alternative suppliers can be recommended.
Identify top-performing suppliers in specific areas.
By following these steps, you can build a comprehensive understanding of your supplier base, enabling more strategic and efficient procurement decisions.
