Overview
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique that helps businesses understand customer purchasing habits. By identifying items that are frequently purchased together, businesses can make informed decisions regarding product placement, promotional strategies, and inventory management.

This project utilizes the mlxtend library in Python to:

Find frequent itemsets based on a minimum support threshold.
Generate association rules from these frequent itemsets, filtered by minimum lift and confidence thresholds.
Dataset
The analysis is performed on the AppleCart.xlsx Excel file. This dataset is expected to be in a transactional format, where each row represents a transaction and columns represent different products. A value of 1 indicates the presence of a product in the transaction, and 0 indicates its absence.

Requirements
To run this code, you'll need the following Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and reading the Excel file.
mlxtend: For implementing the Apriori algorithm and generating association rules.
You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas mlxtend openpyxl
Note: openpyxl is required by pandas to read .xlsx files.

Usage
Clone the repository (or download the files):
git clone <repository_url>
cd AppleCart-Market-Basket-Analysis
Place the AppleCart.xlsx file in the same directory as the Python script.
Run the Python script:
python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file.)
The script will output the filtered association rules to the console.

Analysis Details
The analysis involves the following steps:

Data Loading: The AppleCart.xlsx file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Apriori Algorithm: The apriori function from mlxtend is used to find itemsets that meet a specified minimum support (minimum_required_support = 0.1). Support is the proportion of transactions that contain the itemset.
Association Rule Generation: The association_rules function is then applied to the frequent itemsets to generate rules. These rules are evaluated based on:
Lift: A measure of how much more likely two items are to be purchased together compared to their individual purchase probabilities. A minimum_required_lift = 1.1 is set.
Confidence: The probability that a customer will buy the consequent item, given that they have bought the antecedent item. A minimum_required_confidence = 0.5 is set.
Results
The script will output a pandas DataFrame containing the association rules that satisfy all the defined thresholds (support, lift, and confidence). Each row in the output represents a rule, showing the antecedent (the item(s) on the "if" side), the consequent (the item(s) on the "then" side), and various metrics like support, confidence, and lift.


Business Decision: Target Subsets of Customers for Sending Deal Information

The primary goal here is to segment customers based on their purchasing habits of Pinot Noir and Champagne. By understanding these segments, Chateau can tailor deal information to specific customer groups, increasing the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and ultimately driving more sales.

Code Description

The provided code performs the following steps:

Loads Data: It reads the chateau.csv file into a pandas DataFrame. This file presumably contains customer information, including their purchase history for different wine types.
Initial Data Inspection:
raw_df.head(): Displays the first few rows of the DataFrame to give a quick overview of the data structure and content.
raw_df.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including the number of non-null entries for each column and their data types. This helps in identifying missing values and understanding data types.
raw_df.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical columns. This offers insights into the distribution and range of purchase quantities for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Feature Selection: It creates a new DataFrame selected_columns_df containing only the PinotNoir and Champagne columns. These two columns are the key features for customer segmentation in this analysis.
Display Selected Data: selected_columns_df is displayed to confirm that only the relevant columns have been selected for further analysis.
Warning Filter: warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') is included to suppress any warnings that might arise during the execution, ensuring a cleaner output.
Potential Next Steps for Analysis

To fully achieve the business objective of targeting customer subsets, here are some likely next steps for the analysis:

Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to the selected_columns_df to group customers with similar purchasing patterns. This will reveal distinct customer segments based on their preference for Pinot Noir and Champagne.
Optimal Number of Clusters: If using K-Means, techniques like the "Elbow Method" or "Silhouette Analysis" can be used to determine the optimal number of clusters for effective segmentation.
Visualization: Plotting the clusters (e.g., a scatter plot of Pinot Noir vs. Champagne purchases, colored by cluster) will help visualize the customer segments and understand their characteristics.
Characterize Clusters: Once clusters are formed, analyze the average purchase quantities of Pinot Noir and Champagne within each cluster. This will help define the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., "Champagne Lovers," "Pinot Noir Enthusiasts," "Moderate Buyers").
Deal Strategy Development: Based on the identified customer segments and their characteristics, develop tailored deal strategies. For example:
Customers in a "Champagne Lovers" cluster could receive exclusive Champagne discounts.
"Pinot Noir Enthusiasts" could be targeted with new Pinot Noir releases or special bundles.
Customers who buy both moderately might be interested in mixed wine deals.
Customer Identification: Map the cluster assignments back to the original raw_df using CustomerNo to identify which specific customers belong to each segment. This will allow for direct targeting.



Business Decision: Profile Suppliers

The main objective is to create profiles of suppliers based on their performance metrics and other relevant attributes. This profiling can help in:

Supplier Selection: Identifying the best suppliers for specific needs.
Risk Management: Understanding potential risks associated with different suppliers.
Performance Improvement: Pinpointing areas where supplier performance can be improved.
Negotiation Strategy: Developing effective strategies for contract negotiations.
Code Description

The provided code performs the following steps:

Loads Data: It reads the suppliers.xlsx Excel file into a pandas DataFrame named raw_df. This file is expected to contain various details about suppliers, including their performance metrics.
Initial Data Inspection: raw_df.head() displays the first few rows of the DataFrame. This is a crucial initial step to:
Verify that the data has been loaded correctly.
Understand the column names and the type of data they contain.
Get a quick glance at the data format and structure.
Potential Next Steps for Analysis

To achieve the business objective of profiling suppliers, here are some logical next steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Depending on the extent of missing data, strategies like imputation or removal of rows/columns might be necessary.
Handle Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate supplier entries to ensure accurate analysis.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure all columns have appropriate data types. For instance, 'Cost/Price' might be an object type and need conversion to numeric.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive Statistics: Use raw_df.describe() to get statistical summaries of numerical columns (e.g., Cost/Price, Srvice_Cooperation, Conforming_Service, Flexibility, After_sale_service, Complaint_Management, Waiting_Time). This will help in understanding the distribution and range of values.
Categorical Analysis: Analyze categorical columns like Business Area to understand the distribution of suppliers across different business segments.
Visualization: Create visualizations (histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to understand the relationships between different metrics and identify potential outliers or patterns. For example:
Distribution of Cost/Price.
Relationship between Cost/Price and Srvice_Cooperation.
Comparison of average Conforming_Service across different Business Areas.
Feature Engineering (if needed):
Create new features that might be more indicative of supplier performance. For example, a composite "Overall Service Score" could be derived from Srvice_Cooperation, Conforming_Service, Flexibility, After_sale_service, and Complaint_Management.
Supplier Segmentation/Clustering:
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) using relevant numerical features (e.g., performance ratings, cost) to group suppliers into distinct segments. This will help identify different types of suppliers (e.g., "High Performance, High Cost," "Reliable but Slow," "Cost-Effective, Moderate Service").
Supplier Profiling:
Once segments are identified, analyze the characteristics of each segment. This involves looking at the average values of various metrics for each cluster and understanding what defines each group.
Assign meaningful labels or descriptions to each supplier profile.
Actionable Insights and Recommendations:
Based on the supplier profiles, develop concrete recommendations for business decisions. For example, if a "High Cost, Low Service" segment is identified, strategies for negotiation or seeking alternative suppliers can be recommended.
Identify top-performing suppliers in specific areas.
By following these steps, you can build a comprehensive understanding of your supplier base, enabling more strategic and efficient procurement decisions.

🔍 Key Findings from Initial Analysis
Data Overview

The dataset comprises 3000 entries and 10 features.

Memory usage is approximately 234.5 KB, indicating a relatively small dataset.

Crucially, no missing values were found across any columns, which simplifies the initial cleaning process.

Data Types

The features are categorized into:

Numerical: Age, Commision, Duration, Sales

Categorical: Agency_Code, Type, Claimed, Channel, Product Name, Destination

Descriptive Statistics (Numerical Columns)

Age: Ranges from 8 to 84 years, with an average of approximately 38 years.

Commision: Ranges from 0 to 210.21, averaging around 14.53. The spread in values indicates variability in commission amounts.

Duration: Shows a wide range from -1 to 4580. The minimum value of -1 is an anomaly that requires further investigation and handling, as a negative duration is illogical. The average duration is about 70.

Sales: Ranges from 0 to 539, with an average of 60.25. Sales values also exhibit significant variability.

🚀 Next Steps
Based on the initial findings, the following steps are planned:

Data Cleaning:

Address the anomalous -1 value in the Duration column. This may involve removing the affected rows, imputing the values, or transforming them based on domain knowledge.

Univariate Analysis (Visualizations):

Generate histograms and box plots for numerical features (Age, Commision, Duration, Sales) to better understand their distributions, identify outliers, and check for skewness.

Create bar plots for categorical features (Agency_Code, Type, Claimed, Channel, Product Name, Destination) to visualize the frequency and distribution of each category.
